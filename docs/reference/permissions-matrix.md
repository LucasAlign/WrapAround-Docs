# Roles & permissions matrix

What each role can see and do. Visibility is enforced by the server on every request — see
[Roles & who sees what](../concepts/roles-and-visibility.md) for how scope is decided.

The in-app role badges read **Central Admin**, **Coordinator Admin**, **Church Advocate**,
**Support Volunteer** / **Lead Volunteer**, and **Family**.

<!-- @backend: re-confirm the Family-role action cells (marked c) against the handlers in a later pass. -->
